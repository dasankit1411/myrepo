  <h2>A hub for health info</h2>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">The Cleveland Clinic’s Health Hub is a one-stop shop for health tips and news, videos, physician blogs, expert Q&As and live online chats — and has been popular since its official launch on May 1. The site drew about 100,000 visitors in August and was expected to surpass that figure in September, said Scott Linabarger, the clinic’s director of digital marketing.

<h2>Condition-specific content</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
What about patients looking for more in-depth knowledge about their particular condition? Some creative hospitals are using video to offer a richer perspective. Miami Children’s Hospital launched a YouTube channel to spotlight complex surgeries routinely performed on infants and children with congenital heart defects. While the videos are graphic, each has generated tens of thousands of views. The video series does far more to boost the hospital’s reputation as a leader in pediatric surgery than any list of awards or quality indicators. And it appeals directly to the parents who would love to take the child’s place on the operating table by easing their anxiety.
